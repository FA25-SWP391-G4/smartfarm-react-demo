## Authentication

All endpoints require authentication using JWT token. The token must be included in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
```

## Premium Features

Users with Premium role have access to the following additional features:

1. **Advanced plant analytics**: Detailed health metrics and trend analysis
2. **Multiple plant zones management**: Group plants by zones for better organization
3. **Custom dashboard widgets**: Customizable dashboard layout and widgets
4. **Advanced sensor thresholds**: Set complex rules for plant care
5. **Priority customer support**: Faster response time for support requests

## Error Handling

All API endpoints follow a consistent error response format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Error message describing the issue"
}
```

## Implementation Notes

1. The profile management and premium upgrade features use the following components:
   - User model: For profile information and role management
   - Payment model: For payment verification during premium upgrade
   - Authentication middleware: For route protection
   - JWT tokens: For user authentication

2. The user's role is stored in the `role` field and can have one of the following values:
   - `Regular`: Basic user with limited features
   - `Premium`: User with access to all premium features
   - `Admin`: Administrative user with full system access

3. When upgrading to premium, the system verifies that the payment:
   - Belongs to the current user
   - Has a status of "completed"
   - Is a valid payment in the system

4. Profile updates validate input data before saving to prevent invalid or malicious data.

5. Password changes require verification of the current password for security purposes.

## Frontend Integration

Frontend applications should:

1. Include the JWT token in all API requests
2. Handle token expiration and refresh as needed
3. Provide appropriate UI for profile management and premium features
4. Implement form validation for profile updates and password changes

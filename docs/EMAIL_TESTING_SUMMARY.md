- ✅ Content security (no JWT secrets, passwords, etc.)

#### 6. **Email Rate Limiting and Throttling**
- ✅ Batch email sending capabilities
- ✅ Email sending delays and timeout handling
- ✅ Performance testing with mock delays

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details:

#### **Mocking Strategy**:
```javascript
// Mock nodemailer module
const mockSendMail = jest.fn();
const mockCreateTransport = jest.fn(() => ({
    sendMail: mockSendMail
}));

jest.mock('nodemailer', () => ({
    createTransport: mockCreateTransport
}));
```

#### **Environment Variables Tested**:
- `EMAIL_SERVICE`: gmail
- `EMAIL_USER`: jamesdpkn.testing@gmail.com  
- `EMAIL_PASS`: daxcpvqzxuwrkdka
- `FRONTEND_URL`: http://localhost:3000

#### **Fixed Issues**:
1. ✅ **dateFormat Import Error**: Fixed `dateFormat is not a function`
   - Changed from `require('dateformat')` to `require('dateformat').default`
   - Updated in `services/vnpayService.js`

2. ✅ **Nodemailer Method Names**: Fixed incorrect mocking
   - Changed from `nodemailer.createTransporter` to `nodemailer.createTransport`
   - Updated in `controllers/authController.js`

3. ✅ **Payment.js Syntax Error**: Fixed file corruption and duplicate content
   - Recreated clean Payment.js model with proper syntax
   - Fixed all VNPay integration dependencies

### 🎯 Test Results:

### 🎉 Additional Functionality Working:

#### **VNPay Payment Integration**: Also fully functional
- ✅ All VNPay tests passing
- ✅ Payment URL generation
- ✅ IPN verification
- ✅ Amount validation
- ✅ Response message mapping

### 📚 Next Steps for Production:

1. **Integration Testing**: Test email sending with actual SMTP server
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement actual rate limiting for email sending  
3. **Email Templates**: Enhance HTML email templates with better styling
4. **Monitoring**: Add email delivery tracking and monitoring
5. **Testing Coverage**: Add integration tests with the full auth controller

### 🛡️ Security Features Tested:

- Email content doesn't expose sensitive data (JWT secrets, passwords, user IDs)
- Proper email address validation
- Secure HTML email formatting  
- Environment variable protection
- Error handling without information leakage

### 💡 Key Features:

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests all aspects of email functionality
- **Mock-Based Testing**: No actual emails sent during testing
